# Zinc #

Yet another ore, but this time for late-game usage!

Zinc is typically produced using a blast furnace, and is a pretty useful
resource. It can be made into batteries (zinc-carbon, zinc-air, etc.) and also
into brass, which also has useful properties.

**NB: Most of this is TBD and not fully fleshed out.**

## Zinc-air batteries ##

Since zinc-carbon batteries are useless when we already have the equivalent of
lead-acid batteries in Factorio, let's add zinc-air batteries. They're actually
pretty energy-dense, and are also fairly cheap to produce. Because of this,
they're being researched for electric vehicle batteries and energy grid power
storage.

So, the rough process to craft them is:
- Mine zinc. Duh.
- Use the blast furnace to turn it into zinc plates
- ???
- Get zinc-air batteries

## Brass ##

Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc, used in many applications because of its
low friction and corrosion resistance. For example, brass is used in:
- Hinges
- Bearings
- Plumbing
- Hose couplings
- Valves

These crafting components can be used in recipes later, along with things like
lubricant in order to reduce friction further.

To get brass, you need to:
- Get Zinc plates
- Get Copper plates
- Crush and mix them both to get a brass blend
- Smelt the brass blend
- Get Brass plates
