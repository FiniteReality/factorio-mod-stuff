# Tar #

Specifically coal tar in this case.

In reality, this is what liquefying coal would produce. It's a very viscous
liquid, not unlike crude oil.

Since Factorio already has a coal liquefaction recipe, and we're not rushing to
delete parts of the base game any time soon, we'll handicap our tar instead.

As part of the [coking] process, tar and various oils are driven off from the
carbon in coal, given names such as:
- Creosote oil
- Pitch
- Bitumen
- Asphalt
- Resin

These byproducts can be used for multiple purposes. For example, creosote oil
is used as a preservative for wood, particularly in rail ties, and pitch is
used to create the asphalt/bitumen road surfacing.

If you haven't guessed where this is going already, here's the lowdown:
- Tarmacadam (or Tarmac for short) is a simple road surfacing consisting of
  gravel (i.e. stone) and tar.
- Asphalt is usually a composite pavement consisting of concrete and an asphalt
  overlay.

The process to make them is something like this:
- Use coking process to produce coal coke and crude tar
- Refine crude tar into tar, and optionally pitch
- Use the tar with stone to create tarmac
- Use the pitch with concrete to create asphalt
- Place them as you wish

## TODO ##

- Extra uses for tar?
  - Currently only Tarmac uses tar
  - Could make the improved process create creosote and pitch?
  - Can trains be affected by tracks???
