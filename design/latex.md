Wood is extremely useless once you get medium and large electric poles, and
substations. Unless you plan on getting into wiring and logic, you're likely
going to end up with chest after chest full of wood as you expand your factory
and clear out trees.

Latex is a type of polymer that's regularly extracted from trees and plants in
general - for example, the latex of opium poppies are dried and used to make
pharmaceuticals. It's also used in creating natural rubber, which is then
used - you guessed it - to make plastic.

The steps are fairly simple:
- Extract the latex from the wood
  - Treetaps are typically used for this purpose, since most of the latex is
    located in the bark
- Refine the latex into rubber
  - This is usually done by letting it sit and "coagulate".
- Vulcanize the rubber
  - This prevents the natural rubber from breaking down. It's biodegradable!
  - Vulcanized rubber is basically a very flexible thermosetting plastic
- Heat up the vulcanized rubber, shape it into the form you want, and let it
  cool down
  - Your new set of rubber wellingtons are ready.

So, we replicate that with a slightly simpler process because 100% accuracy
isn't our aim:
- Wood is processed (entirely) into latex at a chemical plant
- Latex is vulcanized directly into latex pellets
- Latex pellets are smelted in a furnace into plastic
